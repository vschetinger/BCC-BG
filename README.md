# Board Gaming Guidelines and Game List

This is just a draft to organize some information about boardgaming in the FH. 

## General Rules and Etiquette

For this to work, we need people to be civilized and respectful. Please behave as adults, be nice to each other and the games. I will not act as a moderator and set out a code of conduct to be followed, but there are 2 golden rules: 


1. **No food and drinks on top of the surfaces the games are being played**: Put cups on the ground next to you and avoid eating while playing.
2. **When finished with playing make sure there are no missing pieces out of the box**: The library has agreed to store games but they can't be checking for this kind of thing, and some games will be ruined after some components are missing.

I am generally against snitching, but please peer-pressure each other (respectfully) to not break these rules, specially when there is alcohol involved.

## Game Library

Below is a list of games currently available in the library. It is not complete and you can use git pull requests if you want to help me improve it. Later I can add a sort of scoring system to make things more interesting.
